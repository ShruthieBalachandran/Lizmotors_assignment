# Voice query pipeline project

- This project involves creating an AI Voice Assistance Pipeline.
- The pipeline processes a voice query command by:
  1. Converting the voice input into text.
  2. Generating a response using a Large Language Model (LLM).
  3. Converting the generated text back into speech.
  
- **Voice-to-Text Conversion**:
  - Used the Whisper model for conversion.

- **LLM for Text Input**:
  - Utilized the Llama-2 model.

- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**:
  - Implemented Edge-tts for text-to-speech conversion.
